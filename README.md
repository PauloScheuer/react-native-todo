## "To do" app in React Native

An application that uses AsyncStorage to persist user's registered tasks. 
A task, in this context, is a data type with an id, a description and two different dates: 
 - the "estimatedAt", defined in the creation; 
 - the "doneAt", defined when the user marks the task as done.
